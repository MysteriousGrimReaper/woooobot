# Bugs
- Fix command aftermath
- Fix first round mess
- Fix listeners
	- Sometimes, listeners are doubled up
	- Messages sent during results
	- Stop the bot from treating results screen inputs as commands
		- Removing the console command listener would be sad
- Use a library for the graphics progress bars

# Annoyances
- Fix queue ordering being wonky
- Replace `new.json` with `queue.json`
- Remove `pnpm.lock`, `node_modules`, and other symlinks from unison
- Change "could not require" messages to be opt-in, i.e. show "required" messages instead
- Change default new round name to increment any number found in the previous round's name
- Make graphics not look funky after 10,000 points
- Add a way to use `send` with a username

- More ways to process messages
	- Send message to message author feature

- Colored logs
- Pause queue recording
	- Partially solved by changing the hotkey to Ctrl + R instead of R
